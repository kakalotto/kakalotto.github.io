  <h1>drwuvideos email reminder app</h1>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this app is to email students when their assignments are late.</p>  
  <p>Even though Google classroom allows one to see what is missing or late, an email from the teacher will sometimes engender action that would not otherwise happen.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This functionality of this app is that the app scans a Google classroom using Google classroom API, and emails students a status report about their missing asignments using Gmail API.</p>
  <p>If you want a copy of this program, please fill out the contact form below.</p>
